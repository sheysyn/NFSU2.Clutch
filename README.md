# Description

>It's a .asi script file, which simulates the operation of the clutch. 

# How to download

>Download the repo by clicking the green "Code" button and then selecting "Download ZIP".

>Extract the files from the archive and copy the contents from the "COPY_FROM_ME" folder to the game directory.

# Changing bindings or entire code.

>Open the .ini file with any text editor.

>Read the comments and make your decisions.

# How to use

>Launch the game.

>You can shift gears using your custom binds only if the clutch button is pressed.

>You can still use the game's default gear change buttons
(which is easier during drag races), and they don't require holding the clutch.

>Make sure that your in-game gearbox type is manual.

>Use clutch key (default "Num Decimal") to shift into neutral,
after which you can use the hotkeys corresponding to the type
of the selected gearbox (default gearbox type is sequential,
default hotkeys is "Num 1" for downshift and "Num 2" for upshift).

>To toggle between gearbox types (sequential and H-type), (!not in racing mode)
press your modifier_key (default "Left ctrl") and your gearbox_type_switch (default "F8").

>To toggle between zero shifting delay and original one, (!not in racing mode)
press your modifier_key (default "Left ctrl") and your shifting_delay_switch (default "F9").

>To toggle between dashboard patch that shows script gear value (not in-game value)so you can
see what gear you'll be in after releasing the clutch, and original one, (!not in racing mode)
press your modifier_key (default "Left ctrl") and your dashboard_switch (default "F10").

>That's it â€” enjoy!

# What does it do

>Activating clutch shifts your car's gear to Neutral while you can still change gears in the background.

>Releasing the clutch shifts back to whatever gear you shifted.

# Notes

>For better experience try not to overlap your in-game keybinds with script keybinds.

>You can hold down your gear shift key before pressing clutch.
It will register as a shift after clutch is pressed, but it
won't work more than once.

>If you leave a field in the configuration file empty, the default value will be used
(what is written in the comment is for information only; changing it will not change the default value).
